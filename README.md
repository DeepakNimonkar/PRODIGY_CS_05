# PRODIGY_CS_05
This project is a Python-based network packet sniffer that captures and analyzes packets in real time. It is designed as a learning tool for network analysis and cybersecurity enthusiasts to understand how packet sniffing works.
The tool captures live network traffic, displays important details, and logs packet information for further analysis.

The sniffer extracts and displays:
Source IP address
Destination IP address
Protocol type (TCP, UDP, etc.)
Payload data (first few bytes for preview)
Timestamp of packet capture

The captured packets are also logged into a file (packet_log.txt) for later review.
